Experiments
===========

Dependencies
------------

Running the experiments requires the ``netprop`` Python package.


Running
-------

To run the experiments use the ``run_experiments.sh`` bash script located in the ``experiments`` sub-folder. Please run explicitly with bash, by calling ``bash run_experiments.sh``.

- Add the ``-h`` flag to get a help message for the script.
- Add the ``-q`` flag for a quiet run; no messages will be printed to screen.
